# What is this? 

This is an open source project implementing the OpenLS OGC standard. It uses PostGIS+PgRouting and works over Java, so it is multiplatform.

It is still under heavy development. We have done similar projects and now we are uniting all of them on this unique project. 

#  I have more questions, where can I ask them?
